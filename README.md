# Face-Recognition-with-Transfer-Learning
We're building a face recognition system. I am using pretrained FaceNet algoritm for transfer learning.
We have 11 best soccer Player in our database if one of them shows up in the camera(algoritm) it is going to recognize them as one of the best. 
But if the picture is not one of them it is not going to let them in.
